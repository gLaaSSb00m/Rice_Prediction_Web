# TODO: Integrate Ensemble Model with Model Selection Dropdown

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Update `prediction/management/commands/populate_db.py` to add RiceModel entries for MobileNetV2 and XGBoost models.
- [x] Modify `prediction/views.py` to load all models, add model selection parameter, and implement ensemble prediction logic.
- [x] Update `templates/prediction/predict.html` to include a dropdown for model selection (VGG16 or Ensemble).
- [x] Run the `populate_db` management command to add new model entries to the database.
- [x] Test predictions with both VGG16 and Ensemble models to ensure functionality.
- [x] Verify image preprocessing matches for ensemble model.
- [x] Fix XGBoost feature dimension mismatch (1792 vs 1) - need to reshape features properly.
