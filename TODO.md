# Rice Classification Implementation TODO

## Phase 1: Dependencies Setup
- [ ] Update requirements.txt with tensorflow, pillow, numpy
- [ ] Install dependencies

## Phase 2: Model Integration
- [ ] Update predict view to handle image upload
- [ ] Load ConvNeXtBase model from .h5 file
- [ ] Implement image preprocessing for model input
- [ ] Add prediction logic using the loaded model
- [ ] Map model predictions to rice class names

## Phase 3: Frontend Updates
- [ ] Update predict.html to show actual prediction results
- [ ] Display predicted rice type with confidence score
- [ ] Show image preview before upload

## Phase 4: Testing
- [ ] Test with sample rice images
- [ ] Verify all 15 rice types are correctly classified
